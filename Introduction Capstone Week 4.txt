Pandemic has severly limited the available leisure opportunities which negatively affected the holidays of the people. However, once a country successfully flatten the curve, businessess will start to reopen. Though the borders of states may remain closed, it is possible to alleviate the feeling of enclosure to the people by providing diverse venues. By identifying popular venue categories using Foursquare Location Data in a state and suggesting these to a different state, we can create a sense of different land or place. For example, in Sydney, theatres are popular but rare in Brisbane, therefore open a theatre to create a Sydneyesque feeling.
