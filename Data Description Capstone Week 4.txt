The data for this problem uses Foursquare and the location of Australian cities. I will be investigating major cities in Australia namely, Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide therefore their geolocation will be taken through google maps, find their centre longitude and latitude. As for Foursquare, I will be utilizing its /Venues data and setting its radius to 3km.
